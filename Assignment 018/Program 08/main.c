/*Write a program in C where a function is defined
which takes two positive integers as input and
returns the LCM of the two given integers. If the
previous function (of Question 7) is already 
defined, is there a shortcut you can use to define
a function to compute the LCM that calls the 
previous function inside the definition?*/
